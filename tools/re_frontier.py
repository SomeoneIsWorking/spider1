"""re_frontier.py — the RE-frontier progress tracker.

The codemap (docs/codemap.md) answers "what subsystem is where + coarse status".
The issue-catalog answers "did we hit this symptom before". Neither answers the
question this project keeps tripping on: **for the ordered chain of RE steps
toward a faithful behaviour, which step is real reverse-engineering vs a
render/behaviour HACK that jumped ahead of the RE?**

This tool tracks exactly that. It operates over a greppable markdown roadmap
(docs/re-frontier.md) — one entry per RE step, each with a status, its
dependencies (the RE that must land first), where the ground-truth evidence
lives, and the honest gap. It is zero-dependency (stdlib only).

WRITES ARE IN-PLACE SURGERY, NEVER A REGENERATION. The roadmap is a hand-written
document that happens to carry machine-readable fields: multi-paragraph
rationale, dated corrections, tables and "expires if" conditions live between the
entries and inside them. `add`/`set` therefore edit the exact lines they mean to
change and copy every other byte through untouched. Every write is gated on a
preservation check that compares the new text against the old and REFUSES (exit
2, naming the lost lines) if any content the edit did not explicitly intend to
replace would go missing. See `selftest`, and docs/issues/0003 for the loss this
replaced: the previous writer re-serialised only what its parser understood and
silently dropped 1846 lines of rationale in one call.

Statuses (the core axis — real RE vs jumped-ahead hack):
  re-verified   RE'd from ground truth (exe / cooked data) + implemented + VERIFIED on real data
  re-partial    real RE, but a documented honest gap remains
  in-progress   actively being RE'd/implemented, not yet verified
  hack          a shortcut standing in for absent RE -- DEBT. Must be removed and
                replaced with the real mechanism (no-hacks / no-fallbacks hard rule).
  blocked       cannot start: a dependency's RE isn't done (usually COMPUTED, not stored)
  todo          not started
  skip-by-design deliberately not implemented (e.g. Bink startup movies)

Commands:
  list [--area A] [--status S]   table of entries
  show <id>                      full entry
  next [--area A]                steps ready to work (all deps satisfied) + hacks to replace
  hacks                          every hack entry -- the debt list (no-hacks rule)
  blocked                        steps whose deps' RE isn't done yet
  tree [--area A]                dependency tree per area
  stats                          counts by status
  check                          integrity: unknown deps, cycles, missing fields; exit 1 on drift
  add <id> --title T --area A [--status S] [--deps a,b] [--evidence E] [--where W] [--gap G] [--notes N]
  set <id> field=value ...       update fields (status/deps/evidence/where/gap/notes/title/area)
  selftest [--tool P] [--corpus F]  drive a prose-bearing roadmap through add/set and assert
                                 the prose survived; exit 1 on any loss

HEADER = """# RE Frontier — the ordered RE dependency chain toward a faithful port

Tracked by `tools/re_frontier.py` (consult it FIRST; update it in the SAME commit
that changes a step). This is the fine-grained companion to `docs/codemap.md`:
the codemap says *what subsystem exists*, this says *which ordered RE step is
real reverse-engineering vs a hack that jumped ahead*.

**Hard rule (no hacks / no fallbacks):** a `⛔ hack` status is DEBT, never an
acceptable resting state. It marks a shortcut standing in for absent RE and MUST
be removed as its real mechanism lands. `re_frontier.py hacks` is the debt list;
`re_frontier.py next` tells you the next RE-ready step.

**`re-verified` MEANS FAITHFUL to the real target — not "the mechanism runs."** A
step is `re-verified` only when its OUTPUT matches the real game/binary (look /
sound / behavior) on real data. An internal trace ("bytecode reached the call
site", "N rows attached") is a mechanism check, NOT faithfulness — if it runs but
the result doesn't match the real target, it is `re-partial` with the
faithfulness gap named. The user observes the running system; that observation
overrides any internal trace.

**Fail fast & loud:** a failure must surface loudly, never silently fall back —
unless the fallback IS intended behavior of the real target being reproduced.

Statuses: ✅ re-verified · 🟡 re-partial (honest gap) · 🔬 in-progress ·
⛔ hack (debt, must remove) · ⬜ todo · ➖ skip-by-design · ⏸ blocked (computed).
